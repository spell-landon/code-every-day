# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: February 2, 2022

### Today's Progress:

Today, I am beginning the challenge. I'm starting off with a problem from codewars.com. The Kata for today is to remove the first and last character from a string.

### Thoughts:

Had some initial challenges with this one, I had the logic of the .slice() method backwards at first, but then ended up switching it around and got the answer!

```js
function removeChar(str) {
  return str.slice(1, -1);
}
```
